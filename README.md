1.2 Write a Java program to display the default value of all primitive data types of Java
1.3 Write a program to check two strings are equal or not. 
1.4 To find the sum of command-line arguments and count the invalid integers entered.

1.6 Write a program to demonstrate static variables, methods, and blocks.
1.7 Write a LeapYear.java program that takes a year as input and outputs the Year is a Leap Year or not a Leap Year.
The LeapYear program only works for year >= 1582, corresponding to a year in the Gregorian calendar. So ensure to check for the same. Further, the Leap Year is a Year divisible by 4 and not 100 unless it is divisible by 400. For e.g. 1800 is not a Leap Year and 2000 is a Leap Year.
